# Mini-Project
Online Message Broadcast System
● This project gives a solution to replace the present paper based notice board system with an advanced electronic notice board. This is an echo friendly system as in this paper usage is not required.
● In this method messages will be updated using IP communication between the message and the NodeMcu. Notice boards play a vital role in offices, in shops and mostly in educational institutions.
● At present notice sending system for the events, occasions or any news, which has to
be passed to the students, will be written/printed on paper, put up on the notice
boards present in every floor in the colleges or schools or in offices or in shops.
● A person will be told the news and he has to update this news on all the notice
boards present in the college or school.
● This will be seen mostly during the examination seasons.
● The time table or the schedule of the exams has to be given to the students. This will
be done by writing the details on the notice boards and for small changes we have to
follow the same process again.
● This process consumes time to update all the notice boards and uses more papers
● In commercially available Notice Boards, thee connections require a PC and long
lengths of wire for connections
● Wifi-Enabled Electronic Notice Board has been designed which eliminates use of paper as well as reduce manual work and time
